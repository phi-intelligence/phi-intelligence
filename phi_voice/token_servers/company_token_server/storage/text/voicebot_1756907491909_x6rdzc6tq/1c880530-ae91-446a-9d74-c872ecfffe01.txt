TED BAKER 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Ted Baker, founded in 1988, is a British lifestyle brand known 
for its mid-premium fashion (Ted Baker, 2022). 
In FY2022, the ﬁrm reported £428.2m in revenue but an 
operating loss of £34.6m (–8.1%) and a pre-tax loss of £44.1m 
(–10.3%) (Ted Baker, 2022). 
Inventory days were 182–213 versus an industry average of 
100–140, and in March 2024 the UK trading arm entered 
administration, closing 31 stores (BBC News, 2024). 
The key issues are excessive stock, delayed digital adoption, 
and reliance on physical retail. 
Our proposal focuses on inventory optimisation, accelerated 
e-commerce, and asset-light licensing under Authentic 
Brands Group (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 

Products & Services 
Ted Baker is a British lifestyle brand offering menswear, 
womenswear, footwear, and accessories, positioned in the 
mid-premium segment (Retail Gazette, 2022). 
The brand differentiates itself through a unique British design 
personality and attention to quality, combining style with 
practicality (Ted Baker, 2022). 
Licensing agreements secured after the 2022 acquisition by 
Authentic Brands Group allow the brand to expand internationally 
across Europe, North America, Asia, and the Middle East 
(Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 
Pricing is mid-premium, below luxury competitors like Burberry 
but above fast-fashion players such as ASOS and Boohoo, 
balancing aspiration and accessibility (BBC News, 2024). 

Marketing Plan 
The global premium fashion industry was valued at 
approximately $74 billion in 2023, with steady growth driven 
by sustainability and digitalisation (Statista, 2023). 
Ted Baker targets urban professionals aged 25–45 with 
middle-to-high incomes who seek affordable luxury and 
authenticity (Neha, Joshi & Kumar, 2024). 
Key competitors include Burberry, Reiss, ASOS, and Boohoo, 
all of whom compete on brand strength, speed, or price 
(Reuters, 2023). 
Marketing strategy has shifted towards digital-ﬁrst 
engagement, omnichannel retailing, and 
sustainability-focused storytelling to build consumer loyalty 
and international reach (Bulović & Čović, 2020). 

Financial Analysis 
Ted Baker reported a gross margin of 55.2% in FY2022, but proﬁtability 
and liquidity remain weak, with an operating loss of £34.6 million 
(–8.1%) and pre-tax loss of £44.1 million (–10.3%) (Ted Baker, 2022). 
The company’s current ratio was 1.34 and quick ratio 0.57, highlighting 
tight short-term liquidity (Ted Baker, 2022). 
Inventory levels averaged 182–213 days, well above the industry 
benchmark of 100–140, tying up signiﬁcant working capital (Ted Baker, 
2022). 
The proposed plan includes SKU reduction of 20–30%, real-time 
demand forecasting, and expanded e-commerce channels to increase 
turnover and improve cash ﬂow (Broekhuizen, Fabian & Nguyen, 2021). 
Licensing agreements under Authentic Brands Group reduce ﬁxed costs 
and provide diversiﬁed income streams (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 

T arget Customers & Competitors 
Ted Baker’s core customers are urban professionals aged 25–45, middle-to-upper 
income, who seek aspirational yet affordable luxury (Neha, Joshi & Kumar, 2024). They 
value style, authenticity, and increasingly, sustainable choices (Bodor et al., 2021). 
The UK fashion retail sector is mature but volatile, with pressures from inﬂation, 
rising costs, and shifting consumer preferences (Reuters, 2023).Key competitors 
include luxury brands such as Burberry and Paul Smith, mid-premium rivals like 
Reiss, and fast-fashion players ASOS and Boohoo (Reuters, 2023). 
Ted Baker’s positioning is “affordable luxury with a British twist, ” balancing 
accessibility and exclusivity (Retail Gazette, 2022). 
SWOT Analysis 
Strengths: 
Distinctive British identity and brand heritage (Ted Baker, 2022). 
Strong product design and craftsmanship, supported by global 
licensing partnerships (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 
Weaknesses: 
Proﬁtability challenges and liquidity pressures, with operating losses 
and low quick ratio (Ted Baker, 2022). 
High inventory turnover of 182–213 days compared to industry average 
of 100–140 (Ted Baker, 2022). 
Opportunities: 
Expansion through asset-light licensing in Asia-Paciﬁc and North 
America (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 
Rising demand for sustainable and ethical fashion (Bodor et al., 2021). 
Threats: 
Intense competition from luxury and fast-fashion players (Burberry, 
ASOS, Boohoo) (Reuters, 2023). 
Economic uncertainty and risk of brand dilution through third-party 
licensees (Sky News, 2024). 

Strategy & Action Plan 
Short term: Close loss-making stores, reduce SKUs by 20–30%, implement 
real-time forecasting (Broekhuizen et al., 2021). 
Medium term: Strengthen e-commerce, expand sustainable lines, rebrand 
around eco-innovation (Bodor et al., 2021). 
Long term: Grow licensing in Asia and North America, maintain gearing below 
40% (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 
Why Invest 
Reason 1: Brand Strength and Recognition 
Ted Baker has built a strong reputation as a British lifestyle brand with more than 
35 years of heritage (The Guardian, 2024).It is recognised internationally for its 
distinctive design personality, attention to detail, and product quality (Ted Baker, 
2022). 
Despite challenges in the UK market, the brand maintains visibility and consumer 
trust through global licensing and partnerships (Authentic Brands Group, 
2024). This strong equity forms a foundation for recovery and long-term 
competitiveness. 
Why Invest 
Reason 2: Growth Potential and Market Opportunity 
Ted Baker is pivoting to an asset-light licensing model, reducing ﬁxed costs and 
operational exposure (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 
The strategy includes SKU rationalisation and demand-based forecasting to improve 
cash ﬂow and inventory efficiency (Broekhuizen, Fabian & Nguyen, 2021). 
Digital-ﬁrst initiatives and sustainability-focused product lines align the brand with 
current consumer expectations and industry trends (Bulović & Čović, 2020; Bodor et al., 
2021). 
This approach lowers risk while positioning the brand for stable, scalable growth. 
Why Invest 
Reason 2: Growth Potential and Market Opportunity 
The global premium fashion market was valued at approximately $74 billion in 2023, with 
growing demand for sustainable and ethical products (Statista, 2023; Bodor et al., 2021). 
Ted Baker’s licensing model enables rapid, low-risk entry into high-potential regions including 
Asia-Paciﬁc, North America, and the Middle East (Authentic Brands Group, 2024). 
Rising consumer interest in sustainability and digital shopping provides additional avenues for 
growth and brand differentiation (Neha, Joshi & Kumar, 2024). 
This expansion strategy positions Ted Baker to diversify revenues and regain proﬁtability. 
Final. 
In summary, Ted Baker remains a well-recognised British brand with over three 
decades of heritage and loyal consumers. Despite recent challenges, including 
signiﬁcant operating losses and store closures, the business has a clear and credible 
route to recovery. By reducing inventory through data-driven forecasting, pivoting to an 
asset-light licensing model, and investing in digital and sustainable growth, Ted Baker 
can restore proﬁtability and strengthen its global presence. 
This strategy reduces risk, improves liquidity, and positions the brand to capture 
opportunities in expanding markets such as Asia-Paciﬁc and North America. With the 
right investment, Ted Baker has the potential to deliver strong returns and long-term 
value. We invite you to support this vision and be part of a brand renewal that combines 
heritage, innovation, and resilience.”
