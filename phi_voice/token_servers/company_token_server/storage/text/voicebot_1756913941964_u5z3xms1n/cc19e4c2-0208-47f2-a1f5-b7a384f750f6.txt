Reflective
 
Report
 
 
Introduction
 
The
 
process
 
of
 
researching
 
and
 
writing
 
my
 
dissertation
 
on
 
Artificial
 
Intelligence
 
(AI)
 
adoption
 
among
 
UK
 
SMEs
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
highly
 
demanding
 
yet
 
rewarding
 
journey .
 
It
 
has
 
required
 
me
 
to
 
develop
 
academic,
 
personal,
 
and
 
professional
 
skills,
 
including
 
critical
 
thinking,
 
time
 
management,
 
data
 
synthesis,
 
and
 
scholarly
 
writing.
 
Using
 
Gibbs’
 
Reflective
 
Cycle
 
as
 
a
 
framework,
 
this
 
report
 
reflects
 
on
 
the
 
stages
 
of
 
the
 
process,
 
the
 
challenges
 
encountered,
 
the
 
lessons
 
learned,
 
and
 
how
 
these
 
experiences
 
will
 
shape
 
my
 
future
 
academic
 
and
 
professional
 
development.
 
Description
 
The
 
thesis
 
focused
 
on
 
identifying
 
how
 
UK
 
SMEs
 
plan
 
AI
 
adoption,
 
what
 
hinders
 
and
 
drives
 
adoption,
 
and
 
how
 
AI
 
influences
 
decision-making,
 
competitiveness,
 
and
 
innovation.
 
Compared
 
with
 
primary
 
research,
 
I
 
had
 
employed
 
a
 
secondary
 
qualitative
 
approach.
 
That
 
entailed
 
thoroughly
 
examining
 
and
 
integrating
 
35-40
 
sources
 
of
 
academic
 
and
 
practitioner
 
literature
 
through
 
a
 
thematic
 
analysis
 
framework.
 
The
 
work
 
required
 
me
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
three
 
main
 
tasks:
 
1.
 
Carrying
 
out
 
systematic
 
literature
 
review
 
on
 
several
 
databases,
 
and
 
adhering
 
to
 
PRISMA
 
guidelines
 
for
 
ensuring
 
rigour .
 
2.
 
Carrying
 
out
 
thematic
 
analysis
 
using
 
Braun
 
and
 
Clarke’ s
 
(2006)
 
six-step
 
process,
 
identifying
 
patterns
 
across
 
differing
 
studies.
 
3.
 
Structuring
 
and
 
writing
 
six
 
chapters
 
that
 
addressed
 
the
 
research
 
objectives,
 
linked
 
results
 
to
 
theory ,
 
and
 
drew
 
practical
 
and
 
theoretical
 
conclusions.
 
Feelings
 
I
 
was
 
both
 
excited
 
and
 
intimidated
 
at
 
first.
 
Adoption
 
of
 
AI
 
by
 
SMEs
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
recent
 
and
 
very
 
rapidly
 
expanding
 
area
 
of
 
study ,
 
and
 
so
 
it
 
presented
 
an
 
intellectual
 
challenge.
 
However ,
 
the
 
wealth
 
of
 
literature
 
and
 
the
 
speed
 
at
 
which
 
technologies
 
are
 
changing
 
also
 
gave
 
rise
 
to
 
feelings
 
of
 
doubt:
 
would
 
I
 
struggle
 
to
 
sift,
 
synthesise,
 
and
 
critically
 
examine
 
such
 
an
 
extensive
 
evidence
 
base?
 
In
 
the
 
intermediate
 
stages,
 
specifically
 
during
 
literature
 
review ,
 
I
 
felt
 
overwhelmed.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
studies
 
overlapped
 
on
 
content
 
but
 
differ
 
in
 
method
 
quality .
 
At
 
first,
 
I
 
found
 
it
 
difficult
 
not
 
to
 
merely
 
summarize
 
sources
 
instead
 
of
 
critically
 
synthesizing
 
them.However ,
 
as
 
I
 
progressed,
 
I
 
began
 
to
 
feel
 
more
 
confident
 
and
 
motivated.
 
Recognising
 
patterns
 
across
 
studies,
 
for
 
example
 
that
 
technological
 
complexity
 
is
 
less
 
of
 
a
 
barrier
 
in
 
the
 
UK
 
due
 
to
 
digital
 
maturity ,
 
gave
 
me
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
achievement
 
and
 
ownership
 
of
 
new
 
insights.
 
Completing
 
each
 
chapter
 
increased
 
my
 
confidence
 
in
 
my
 
ability
 
to
 
engage
 
critically
 
with
 
complex
 
material
 
and
 
present
 
findings
 
coherently .
 
Evaluation
 
There
 
were
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
 
in
 
the
 
experience
 
of
 
doing
 
the
 
dissertation.
 
The
 
strengths
 
were
 
development
 
of
 
good
 
literature
 
searching
 
skills.
 
Through
 
the
 
refining
 
of
 
search
 
terms
 
and
 
systematic
 
screening
 
of
 
sources,
 
it
 
was
 
possible
 
to
 
obtain
 
breadth
 
and
 
depth.
 
Analytical
 
skills
 
were
 
also
 
developed
 
so
 
that
 
it
 
became
 
possible
 
to
 
move
 
from
 
describing
 
to
 
synthesising,
 
which
 
is
 
an
 
essential
 
skill
 
at
 
higher
 
levels
 
of
 
study .
 
Another
 
positive
 
was
 
my
 
time
 
management
 
improvement.
 
At
 
first,
 
I
 
underestimated
 
the
 
time
 
required
 
for
 
referencing
 
and
 
proofreading.
 
Midway
 
through,
 
I
 
adopted
 
weekly
 
planning
 
sessions
 
and
 
broke
 
down
 
tasks
 
into
 
smaller
 
milestones.
 
This
 
gave
 
me
 
better
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
workload
 
and
 
reduced
 
stress.
 
On
 
the
 
negative
 
side,
 
it
 
was
 
at
 
times
 
challenging
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
keep
 
academic
 
voice.
 
Since
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
practitioner
 
reports
 
contained
 
persuasive
 
writing,
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
consciously
 
refrain
 
from
 
adopting
 
their
 
style
 
and
 
instead
 
keep
 
detached.
 
Word
 
count
 
limits
 
also
 
bothered
 
me.
 
Chapters
 
2
 
and
 
5
 
had
 
the
 
potential
 
of
 
going
 
well
 
beyond
 
the
 
limit,
 
so
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
make
 
intentional
 
choices
 
regarding
 
leaving
 
out
 
areas,
 
which
 
frustrated
 
me
 
but
 
ended
 
up
 
educating
 
me
 
on
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
succinctness.
 
Analysis
 
Reflecting
 
on
 
why
 
challenges
 
occurred,
 
I
 
realise
 
that
 
many
 
arose
 
from
 
the
 
complexity
 
of
 
secondary
 
qualitative
 
research.
 
Without
 
primary
 
data,
 
I
 
depended
 
on
 
other
 
researchers’
 
designs,
 
meaning
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
be
 
critical
 
about
 
methodological
 
rigour
 
and
 
potential
 
bias.
 
This
 
sharpened
 
my
 
evaluative
 
skills,
 
as
 
I
 
learned
 
to
 
distinguish
 
between
 
high-quality
 
peer-reviewed
 
evidence
 
and
 
less
 
reliable
 
grey
 
literature.
 
It
 
also
 
illustrated
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
theoretical
 
foundations.
 
Through
 
the
 
application
 
of
 
TOE,
 
TAM/UT AUT2,
 
and
 
DOI
 
theories
 
as
 
ways
 
of
 
framing
 
the
 
analysis,
 
I
 
was
 
able
 
to
 
comment
 
on
 
findings
 
systematically
 
instead
 
of
 
getting
 
bogged
 
down
 
in
 
detail.
 
The
 
identification
 
of
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
ethical
 
governance
 
and
 
trust
 
being
 
separately
 
and
 
clearly
 
included
 
in
 
adoption
 
models
 
came
 
from
 
examining
 
these
 
models
 
intensively
 
and
 
pitting
 
them
 
against
 
evidence.
 
Lastly ,
 
the
 
reflective
 
element
 
revealed
 
for
 
me
 
the
 
function
 
of
 
resilience
 
and
 
flexibility .
 
Preliminary
 
stress
 
regarding
 
scope
 
was
 
alleviated
 
when
 
I
 
understood
 
that
 
I
 
could
 
write
 
iteratively—pulling
 
together ,
 
rewriting,
 
and
 
fine-tuning
 
sections.
 
The
 
writing
 
of
 
the
 
discussion
 
chapter
 
marked
 
a
 
watershed,
 
at
 
which
 
point
 
I
 
moved
 
from
 
merely
 
reporting
 
results
 
to
 
critically
 
interpreting
 
them.
 
Conclusion
 
Overall,
 
the
 
dissertation
 
has
 
represented
 
a
 
transformative
 
learning
 
experience.
 
It
 
enriched
 
my
 
subject
 
knowledge
 
of
 
AI
 
adoption
 
and
 
extended
 
my
 
academic
 
capabilities
 
of
 
research
 
design,
 
critical
 
analysis,
 
and
 
scholarly
 
communication.
 
It
 
taught
 
me
 
how
 
to
 
handle
 
uncertainty ,
 
work
 
effectively
 
on
 
time,
 
and
 
construct
 
evidence-based
 
arguments.
 
The
 
process
 
also
 
refined
 
my
 
professional
 
confidence,
 
and
 
now
 
I
 
am
 
able
 
to
 
participate
 
effectively
 
in
 
current
 
debates
 
on
 
digital
 
transformation
 
with
 
greater
 
authority .
 
Action
 
Plan
 
Looking
 
forward,
 
I
 
plan
 
to
 
apply
 
the
 
lessons
 
learned
 
in
 
three
 
ways:
 
1.
 
Academic
 
development
 
–
 
I
 
will
 
continue
 
refining
 
my
 
critical
 
writing
 
by
 
engaging
 
in
 
research
 
projects
 
and
 
publications.
 
I
 
intend
 
to
 
build
 
on
 
this
 
dissertation
 
by
 
potentially
 
transforming
 
it
 
into
 
a
 
journal
 
article
 
or
 
conference
 
paper ,
 
focusing
 
particularly
 
on
 
the
 
novel
 
theoretical
 
contribution
 
regarding
 
ethics
 
and
 
trust
 
in
 
AI
 
adoption.
 
 
2.
 
Professional
 
application
 
–As
 
a
 
professional,
 
when
 
working
 
on
 
consultancy ,
 
policy ,
 
or
 
business
 
strategy ,
 
integration
 
of
 
complex
 
information
 
and
 
providing
 
evidence-informed
 
recommendations
 
will
 
also
 
prove
 
very
 
beneficial.
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
professional
 
development,
 
practicing
 
integration
 
of
 
theory
 
and
 
practice,
 
as
 
has
 
been
 
carried
 
out
 
with
 
TOE
 
and
 
TAM
 
models
 
here,
 
will
 
also
 
continue.
 
 
3.
 
Personal
 
growth
 
–A
 
Personal
 
development
 
–
 
I
 
will
 
retain
 
the
 
time
 
management
 
system
 
forged
 
through
 
the
 
dissertation,
 
e.g.,
 
planning
 
of
 
milestones
 
and
 
reflective
 
check-ins,
 
for
 
use
 
with
 
both
 
academics
 
and
 
professional
 
engagements.
 
I
 
also
 
plan
 
to
 
accept
 
reflection
 
as
 
a
 
habitual
 
process,
 
which
 
will
 
aid
 
me
 
in
 
continuously
 
learning
 
and
 
adapting.
